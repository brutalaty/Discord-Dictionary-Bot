# Dictionary-Bot
A very simple bot that shows the definitions of entered words.

The dictionary used is https://wordsapi.com

example:
\`define peristalsis

Dictionary-Bot will also respond to \`Hello




To use this bot you must:

enter your Discord.js key/token into config.json in the root folder

enter your wordsapi key into src/components/Definition/RapidApi/config.json

Optionally, you can change your delimiter config.json in the root folder.
